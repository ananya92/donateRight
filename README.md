# Donate Right
A charity-based application for directing users towards those in need.

## Mission Statement
Our mission is to connect donors and verified charities across Australia on a single platform so that every individual is notified about the needs of the society and can help provide faster assistance to those in need.

## Motivation
Due to the busy lifestyle of people today it is hard for individuals to take out time to contribute to society. Also, charities need the support and contribution from more and more people so that they can reach out to maximum people in need. Mostly the charity based applications existing today request for monetary contributions. But money isn't the only way to give back to society. There are other ways in which each one of us can contribute to society, for example, your old clothes can be donated instead of throwing away, your old books gathering dust can be donated to a reader without means, your skills garnered with years of educational and profesional training can be donated to teach people who can't afford to get the same level of training. 

Currently there is no single platform where individuals wishing to donate and different charities can directly come together. The core idea of "Donate Right" is to bridge the gap between charities and donors.

* Using Donate Right, people don't have to wait for NGOs to approach them and can donate on their own by simply posting a donation on the app. 
* People seeking help can directly contact the donors by filtering the category of posted donation eg, food, clothes, books, toys, medicines, household appliances and even skills. 
* Charities would be able to effectively communicate to people regarding their upcoming events and activities.

## How is works? 

* An individual can register as a donor and a charity can register itself and the charity users on Donate Right.
* A regular user would be able to -
1. Post donations
2. View upcoming events hosted by charities
3. Search for a particular charity

* A charity user would be able to -
1. Post charity events organized by the charity
2. View all donation posted by people and contact them if they can help channel the donation to someone in need
3. Search other charities to collaborate with them
